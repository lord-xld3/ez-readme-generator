## Description

Creates a basic readme.md file

## Install

Clone repo, then "node .\index.js"

## Usage

All prompts are optional, if left blank they will not be included

I'm not adding screenshots here. If you can install node and run this index file then you can probably read the prompts.

## Tests

It will make a readme.md file if it works

## Contribution

I hate inquirer so much that I want to make my own package. This should be as simple as "iq(prompt,output,?optional_callback_function)" instead of the mess I've created. It's like using a chainsaw to cut a tomato, its more complicated than it needs to be and it drives me nuts.
